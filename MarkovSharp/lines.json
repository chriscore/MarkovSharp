There is a visible labor and there is an invisible labor. ","MTV is the lava lamp of the 1980's. ","Before we get too depressed about the state of our politics, let's remember our history. The great debates of the past, all stirred great passions. They all made somebody angry, and at least once led to a terrible war. What is amazing, is that despite all the conflict, our experiment in democracy has worked better than any form of government on earth.

","The first precept was never to accept a thing as true until I knew it as such without a single doubt.

","I have never made but one prayer to God, a very short one: 'O Lord, make my enemies ridiculous.' And God granted it. ","Fasting and natural diet, though essentially unknown [in today's U.S.] as a therapy, should be the first treatment when someone discovers that she or he has a medical problem.

And you know that if you don't have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone by the next morning. Sometimes it's important to wake up and stop dreaming. When a really great dream shows up, grab it. ","Facing a mirror you see merely your own countenance; facing your child you finally understand how everyone else has seen you. ","I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you. ","There's always one who loves and one who lets himself be loved. ","It's just human. We all have the jungle inside of us. We all have wants and needs and desires, strange as they may seem. If you stop to think about it, we're all pretty creative, cooking up all these fantasies. it's like a kind of poetry. ","Those whom we support hold us up in life. ","All phone calls are obscene.

","America is a country that doesn't know where it is going but is determined to set a speed record getting there. ","A good man would prefer to be defeated than to defeat injustice by evil means. ","Journalism is just a gun. It's only got one bullet in it, but if you aim right, that's all you need. Aim it right and you can blow a kneecap off the world. ","There is properly no history, only biography. ","Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles. ","The probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just. ","That consciousness is everything and that all things begin with a thought. That we are responsible for our own fate, we reap what we sow, we get what we give, we pull in what we put out. I know these things for sure. ","Technology is a way of organizing the universe so that man doesn't have to experience it. ","If you really want something, and really work hard, and take advantage of opportunities, and never give up, you will find a way. ","My parents only had one argument in forty-five years. It lasted forty-three years. ","The power to bring me out of solitude - or to push me back into it - had never belonged to another person. It was mine and only mine. ","We live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities. ","I decided not to let my past rule my future so I decided to change my present in order to open up my future. ","When children feel they have to earn our love by what they accomplish, they never feel good about themselves, no matter how much they do, no matter what their age. Indeed, some adults work outrageous hours, make huge salaries, and always strive to accomplish more and yet are never satisfied, no matter what they have achieved. This is because they were never given the free, unconditional love of their parents, the love that is every child’s birthright. ","When in doubt, tell the truth. ","For me, words are a form of action, capable of influencing change. ","There is a lot more to life than just struggling to make money. ","No one can be right all of the time, but it helps to be right most of the time. ","Everything in the world may be endured except continued prosperity. ","There is no doubt that the first requirement for a composer is to be dead. ","A good listener is a good talker with a sore throat. ","Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man's original virtue. It is through disobedience and rebellion that progress has been made. ","No degree of dullness can safeguard a work against the determination of critics to find it fascinating. ","Now that I've relinquished my fantasies of all the people I wish I could be, and stopped feeling guilty about [them], I have more time for the things that I truly enjoy. ","I think it's absolutely a blessing when you just know what your purpose is and your destiny. I don't think it's a curse at all. ","Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinctions. No dignity, no learning, no force of character, can make any stand against good wit. ","Speak properly, and in as few words as you can, but always plainly; for the end of speech is not ostentation, but to be understood. ","Habit is habit and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but coaxed downstairs a step at a time. ","When I am attacked by gloomy thoughts, nothing helps me so much as running to my books. They quickly absorb me and banish the clouds from my mind. ","My focus has always been on talent over looks. This theme of people putting an emphasis on looks first has been a constant reminder throughout my life that most people don’t see things in the same way that I do. ","You're confusing product with process. Most people, when they criticize, whether they like it or hate it, they're talking about product. That's not art, that's the result of art. Art, to whatever degree we can get a handle on (I'm not sure that we really can) is a process. It begins in the heart and the mind with the eyes and hands. ","No human thing is of serious importance. ","The truth is the kindest thing we can give folks in the end. ","We don't know who we are until we see what we can do. ","How little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it. ","The future, according to some scientists, will be exactly like the past, only far more expensive. ","Another unsettling element in modern art is that common symptom of immaturity, the dread of doing what has been done before. ","Creativity can solve almost any problem. The creative act, the defeat of habit by originality, overcomes everything. ","People often write me and ask how I keep my wood floors so clean when I live with a child and a dog, and my answer is that I use a technique called Suffering From a Mental Illness. ","Humor is always based on a modicum of truth. Have you ever heard a joke about a father-in-law? ","If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style. ","Your theory is crazy, but it's not crazy enough to be true. ","You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you. ","Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still. ","The only way to have a friend is to be one. ","The men the American public admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars; the men they detest most violently are those who try to tell them the truth. ","The wisest men follow their own direction. ","Camping is nature's way of promoting the motel business. ","My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind. ","Eat a live toad the first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day. ","What is food to one, is to others bitter poison. ","Nothing is as far away as one minute ago. ","I can't bring myself to say, 'Well, I guess I'll be toddling along.' It isn't that I can't toddle. It's just that I can't guess I'll toddle. ","The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think. ","I'm just a person trapped inside a woman's body. ","People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy. ","What you do speaks so loud that I cannot hear what you say. ","There is nothing like dream to create the future. Utopia to-day, flesh and blood tomorrow.

","I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy. ","To punish me for my contempt for authority, fate made me an authority myself. ","You can't love anyone until you understand that you can't love everyone. ","Love truth, and pardon error. ","People say to me so often, 'Jane how can you be so peaceful when everywhere around you people want books signed, people are asking these questions and yet you seem peaceful,' and I always answer that it is the peace of the forest that I carry inside. ","Women are better at acting then men. Why? Because we have to be. If successfully convincing someone bigger than you are of something he doesn't want to know is a survival skill, this is how women have survived through the millennia. ","When real people fall down in life, they get right back up and keep on walking. ","Every time we remember to say \"thank you,\" we experience nothing less than heaven on earth. ","It was one of those perfect English autumnal days which occur more frequently in memory than in life. ","Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet. ","There are so many different ways lives work out, so many stories, and every one of them is precious: full of joy and heartbreak, and a fair amount of situation comedy. ","Under all speech that is good for anything there lies a silence that is better. Silence is deep as Eternity; speech is shallow as Time. ","When you own or take responsibility for your feelings, you place yourself in a position of power and control. ","Brass bands are all very well in their place - outdoors and several miles away.

","I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers. ","If I had my life to live over... I'd dare to make more mistakes next time. ","I only know two pieces; one is 'Clair de Lune' and the other one isn't. ","I am never afraid of what I know. ","Death is only going to happen to you once; I don't want to miss it.

","I said to myself, I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me - shapes and ideas so near to me - so natural to my way of being and thinking that it hasn't occurred to me to put them down.

","It is good to be without vices, but it is not good to be without temptations. ","Letting your customers set your standards is a dangerous game, because the race to the bottom is pretty easy to win. Setting your own standards--and living up to them--is a better way to profit. Not to mention a better way to make your day worth all the effort you put into it. ","If you live long enough, the venerability factor creeps in; first, you get accused of things you never did, and later, credited for virtues you never had.

","The voracious ambition of humans is never sated by dreams coming true, because there is always the thought that everything might be done better and again. ","You don’t remember what happened. What you remember becomes what happened. ","The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in. ","Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.

","When you go into court you are putting your fate into the hands of twelve people who weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty.

","Love is, above all else, the gift of oneself. ","Inspiration is wonderful when it happens, but the writer must develop an approach for the rest of the time... The wait is simply too long. ","The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. ","It is our choices...that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. ","But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts. ","Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done and why. Then do it.

You ask yourself, How did I get here? What was it about? Was it her smile? Was it the way she crossed her legs, the turn of her ankle, the poignant vulnerability of her slender wrists? What are these elusive and ephemeral things that ignite passion in the human heart? That's an age-old question. It's perfect food for thought on a bright midsummer's night. ","The victory of success is half won when one gains the habit of setting goals and achieving them. Even the most tedious chore will become endurable as you parade through each day convinced that every task, no matter how menial or boring, brings you closer to fulfilling your dreams. ","Genuine goodness is threatening to those at the opposite end of the moral spectrum. ","There's no correlation between creativity and equipment ownership. None. Zilch. Nada. Actually, as the artist gets more into his thing, and as he gets more successful, his number of tools tends to go down. He knows what works for him. Expending mental energy on stuff wastes time. ","We can’t let our insecurities own or destroy us. We have to face them head-on. That was part of the challenge that motivated me to take this journey. I wanted to see what I could do and, more important, I wanted to understand everything that was holding me back. ","An intellectual snob is someone who can listen to the William Tell Overture and not think of The Lone Ranger. ","It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.

","It doesn't make a difference what temperature a room is, it's always room temperature. ","It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. ","People forget how fast you did a job - but they remember how well you did it. ","Don't worry about people stealing an idea. If it's original, you will have to ram it down their throats. ","Never get angry. Never make a threat. Reason with people. ","By a curious confusion, many modern critics have passed from the proposition that a masterpiece may be unpopular to the other proposition that unless it is unpopular it cannot be a masterpiece. ","The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim. ","If you would thoroughly know anything, teach it to others. ","A joyful life is an individual creation that cannot be copied from a recipe. ","For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. ","Feelings are really your GPS system for life. When your supposed to do something, or not supposed to do something, your emotional guidance system lets you know.

","The most wasted day of all is that in which we have not laughed. ","No one is ready for a thing until he believes he can acquire it. ","Guns don't kill people. People who say \"Guns don't kill people\" kill people. With guns. ","My Karma ran over your dogma. ","Anger makes you smaller, while forgiveness forces you to grow beyond what you were. ","There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion. ","Flowers never emit so sweet and strong a fragrance as before a storm. When a storm approaches thee, be as fragrant as a sweet-smelling flower. ","Make all you can, save all you can, give all you can. ","All human beings should try to learn before they die what they are running from, and to, and why. ","When you look at yourself from a universal standpoint, something inside always reminds or informs you that there are bigger and better things to worry about. ","Whatever you think, be sure it is what you think; whatever you want, be sure that is what you want; whatever you feel, be sure that is what you feel. ","Fostering a spirit of cooperation with your ex means laying down your weapons in the war of divorce in order to protect your children. ","A liberal is a person whose interests aren't at stake at the moment. ","To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold. ","The bravest thing you can do when you are not brave is to profess courage and act accordingly. ","To predict the behavior of ordinary people in advance, you only have to assume that they will always try to escape a disagreeable situation with the smallest possible expenditure of intelligence. ","One man that has a mind and knows it can always beat ten men who haven't and don't. ","'Tis the most tender part of love, each other to forgive. ","It's a sad day when you find out that it's not accident or time or fortune, but just yourself that kept things from you. ","If it weren't for my lawyer, I'd still be in prison. It went a lot faster with two people digging. ","A little more moderation would be good. Of course, my life hasn't exactly been one of moderation. ","I have such poor vision I can date anybody.

","Television is the first truly democratic culture - the first culture available to everybody and entirely governed by what the people want. The most terrifying thing is what people do want.

","It's very hard to take yourself too seriously when you look at the world from outer space. ","It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. ","Every minute you are thinking of evil, you might have been thinking of good instead. Refuse to pander to a morbid interest in your own misdeeds. Pick yourself up, be sorry, shake yourself, and go on again. ","Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes.) ","When we remember we are all mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands explained. ","Did I ever tell you about a nasty habit that flight attendants pick up on the job? We learn to always keep smiling, even when we're out of Bloody Mary Mix. ","Whenever it is in any way possible, every boy and girl should choose as his life work some occupation which he should like to do anyhow, even if he did not need the money.

","At a dinner party one should eat wisely but not too well, and talk well but not too wisely. ","To obtain a man's opinion of you, make him mad. ","I enjoy being a highly overpaid actor. ","This is the sixth book I've written, which isn't bad for a guy who's only read two. ","The man who writes about himself and his own time is the only man who writes about all people and all time. ","Some have been thought brave because they were afraid to run away. ","A great many people think they are thinking when they are really rearranging their prejudices. ","Giving is a necessity sometimes... more urgent, indeed, than having. ","The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.

","Thanks to the Interstate Highway System, it is now possible to travel from coast to coast without seeing anything. ","The roots of true achievement lie in the will to become the best that you can become. ","This paperback is very interesting, but I find it will never replace a hardcover book - it makes a very poor doorstop. ","Conceit is God's gift to little men. ","Love all, trust a few. Do wrong to none. ","Youth would be an ideal state if it came a little later in life. ","People say that life is the thing, but I prefer reading. ","One must also accept that one has 'uncreative' moments. The more honestly one can accept that, the quicker these moments will pass. ","Where we have strong emotions, we're liable to fool ourselves. ","Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language. ","Oh, darling, let your body in, let it tie you in, in comfort. ","What you don't see with your eyes, don't invent with your mouth. ","I live now on borrowed time, waiting in the anteroom for the summons that will inevitably come. And then - I go on to the next thing, whatever it is. One doesn't luckily have to bother about that. ","Regret for the things we did can be tempered by time; it is regret for the things we did not do that is inconsolable. ","The really frightening thing about middle age is that you know you'll grow out of it. ","Leave it to a girl to take the fun out of sex discrimination.

It's just the way of things. Nothing stays the same. ","Give to every other human being every right that you claim for yourself. ","Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so. ","I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them. ","Try to love someone who you want to hate, because they are just like you, somewhere inside, in a way you may never expect, in a way that resounds so deeply within you that you cannot believe it. ","Though I am not naturally honest, I am so sometimes by chance. ","So, let us not be blind to our differences - but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. ","The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not. We have plenty of messenger boys. ","If the wind will not serve, take to the oars. ","Grief does not change you, it reveals you. ","There is nothing like a newborn baby to renew your spirit - and to buttress your resolve to make the world a better place. ","With most men, unbelief in one thing springs from blind belief in another. ","A moment's insight is sometimes worth a lifetime's experience. ","My toughest fight was with my first wife. ","I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. ","I stand in awe of my body. ","Blessed are they who heal you of self-despisings. Of all services which can be done to man, I know of none more precious. ","I have found that it don't really matter if you're brought up fine or rough, but that it helps to have someone to spill your sorrows to. ","The surprising thing about young fools is how many survive to become old fools. ","I take the view, and always have, that if you cannot say what you are going to say in twenty minutes you ought to go away and write a book about it.

","If we don't succeed, we run the risk of failure. ","At the present rate of progress, it is almost impossible to imagine any technical feat that cannot be achieved - if it can be achieved at all - within the next few hundred years. ","Under democracy one party always devotes its chief energies to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule - and both commonly succeed, and are right. ","It's kind of fun to do the impossible. ","Thought is only a flash between two long nights, but this flash is everything. ","If computers get too powerful, we can organize them into a committee -- that will do them in. ","Human beings are perhaps never more frightening than when they are convinced beyond doubt that they are right. ","One of the common causes of serious difficulty takes the form of parental self-discovery. The newly adopted child brings out submerged feelings or behavior in his parents that make them dislike themselves. This can be such a severe blow to their self- esteem that they must eradicate the cause of their distress. Sometimes the only way that parents are able to do that is by returning the child. ","Our children change us... whether they live or not. ","Because you are in control of your life. Don't ever forget that. You are what you are because of the conscious and subconscious choices you have made. ","Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint. ","It's very strange when the life you never had flashes before your eyes. ","Thus, in a real sense, I am constantly writing autobiography, but I have to turn it into fiction in order to give it credibility. ","At the end of the day, whether or not those people are comfortable with how you're living your life doesn't matter. What matters is whether you're comfortable with it. ","I do not have a psychiatrist and I do not want one, for the simple reason that if he listened to me long enough, he might become disturbed. ","You have not converted a man because you have silenced him. ","So much of what we call management consists in making it difficult for people to work. ","One doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time. ","Perpetual devotion to what a man calls his business, is only to be sustained by perpetual neglect of many other things. ","Early morning cheerfulness can be extremely obnoxious. ","Go not for every grief to the physician, nor for every quarrel to the lawyer, nor for every thirst to the pot. ","If there was strife and contention in the home, very little else in life could compensate for it. ","A mother only does her children harm if she makes them the only concern of her life. ","What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail? ","Gravity. It keeps you rooted to the ground. In space, there's not any gravity. You just kind of leave your feet and go floating around. Is that what being in love is like? ","Question how much freedom your path affords you. Be utterly ruthless about it. It's your freedom that will get you to where you want to go. ","People who have no weaknesses are terrible; there is no way of taking advantage of them. ","What people say you cannot do, you try and find that you can. ","I dwell in possibility... ","Each handicap is like a hurdle in a steeplechase, and when you ride up to it, if you throw your heart over, the horse will go along, too. ","Let's have some new cliches. ","Friendship make prosperity more shining and lessens adversity by dividing and sharing it. ","Be gentle with the young. ","I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. ‘Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death. ","We hold in our hands, the most precious gift of all: Freedom. The freedom to express our art. Our love. The freedom to be who we want to be. We are not going to give that freedom away and no one shall take it from us! ","Almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble. ","The good or ill of a man lies within his own will. ","Football is a mistake. It combines the two worst elements of American life. Violence and committee meetings. ","Man forgives woman anything save the wit to outwit him. ","Never feel self-pity, the most destructive emotion there is. How awful to be caught up in the terrible squirrel cage of self. ","You cannot depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus. ","Treasure the love you receive above all. It will survive long after your good health has vanished. ","Never lose sight of this important truth, that no one can be truly great until he has gained a knowledge of himself, a knowledge which can only be acquired by occasional retirement. ","Put your whole self into it, and you will find your true voice. Hold back and you won't. It's that simple. ","Use your enemy's hand to catch a snake. ","I hold ambition of so light a quality that is is but a shadow's shadow. ","When the character of a man is not clear to you, look at his friends. ","Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. ","Maybe kissing is sort of like nature's coffee. ","If a problem has no solution, it may not be a problem, but a fact - not to be solved, but to be coped with over time. ","Anger is a signal, and one worth listening to. ","If women are expected to do the same work as men, we must teach them the same things. ","If you know how to spend less than you get, you have the philosopher's stone. ","Men are born to succeed, not fail. ","Whoever ceases to be a student has never been a student. ","When you leave college, there are thousands of people out there with the same degree you have; when you get a job, there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living. But you are the only person alive who has sole custody of your life. ","The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem. It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one. ","Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not ours to command. ","When you win, say nothing. When you lose, say less. ","The way you overcome shyness is to become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid. ","It is a common delusion that you make things better by talking about them. ","Life isn't fair. It's just fairer than death, that's all. ","The first rule of life is to reveal nothing, to be exceptionally cautious in what you say, in whatever company you may find yourself. If you have a secret, you have only to whisper it to your dearest friend with the strictest injunction that it will go no further, and within half a day the story is all over town, and when you do make what would seem to be a perfectly sensible remark, you will find it reported in the most grotesque form, thus incurring no end of criticism to rebound upon you. ","Human beings are seventy percent water, and with some the rest is collagen. ","Aim for success, not perfection. Never give up your right to be wrong, because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move forward with your life. ","Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired. ","Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish. ","We're all in this alone. ","People age even when you're not looking. ","A good many young writers make the mistake of enclosing a stamped, self-addressed envelope, big enough for the manuscript to come back in. This is too much of a temptation to the editor. ","Acting is not being emotional, but being able to express emotion. ","We read frequently if unknowingly, in quest of a mind more original than our own. ","The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated. ","The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to him his own. ","The older I get, the greater power I seem to have to help the world; I am like a snowball - the further I am rolled, the more I gain. ","Two wrongs don't make a right, but they make a good excuse. ","In every power, of which taste is the foundation, excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes. ","One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar. ","If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly. ","You go to movies to see people you love suffer - that's why you go to the movies. You don't go to see a movie about a guy who already knows he has a wonderful life. ","To think about your life is to create it. You have to take ownership of where you are right now and know where you want to go before you can get there. Keep collecting evidence for your success. You can believe it, and you can be it. ","Sure I'm for helping the elderly. I'm going to be old myself some day. ","I am an atheist, myself. A simple faith, but a great comfort to me, in these last days. ","Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it. ","There is no silver bullet and frankly you probably don’t need one. It is far more important to be able to find the right kind of gun, be able to load the gun … and perhaps most importantly, be able to figure out where the werewolf is. ","Under the greenwood tree who loves to lie with me ... Here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather. ","Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former. ","If you have the creative urge, it isn't going to go away. But sometimes it takes a while before you accept the fact. ","No one gossips about other people's secret virtues. ","There are two main strategies we can adopt to improve the quality of life. The first is to try making external conditions match our goals. The second is to change how we experience external conditions to make them fit our goals better.

","Like an ability or a muscle, hearing your inner wisdom is strengthened by doing it. ","A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight.  ","Part of being sane, is being a little bit crazy. ","We are here and it is now. Further than that all human knowledge is moonshine. ","An effective way to deal with predators is to taste terrible. ","Once you can laugh at your own weaknesses, you can move forward. Comedy breaks down walls. It opens up people. If you're good, you can fill up those openings with something positive. Maybe... combat some of the ugliness in the world. ","Desire creates the power. ","Never harbor grudges; they sour your stomach and do no harm to anyone else. ","The reason lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place is that the same place isn't there the second time. ","Read over your compositions, and wherever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out. ","Good habits result from resisting temptation. ","A simple enough pleasure, surely, to have breakfast alone with one's husband, but how seldom married people in the midst of life achieve it. ","Democracy is the name we give the people whenever we need them. ","It's a small world, but I wouldn't want to paint it. ","This book fills a much-needed gap.

","Before a war military science seems a real science, like astronomy; but after a war it seems more like astrology. ","Do not bite at the bait of pleasure till you know there is no hook beneath it. ","Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it. ","The holy passion of Friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last through a whole lifetime, if not asked to lend money. ","In Paris they simply stared when I spoke to them in French; I never did succeed in making those idiots understand their language. ","Friends should always tell you the truth. But please don’t. ","I don't like green Christmases. They're not green—they're just nasty faded browns and grays. ","People find life entirely too time-consuming. ","It is not fair to ask of others what you are unwilling to do yourself. ","Here's a tip to avoid death by celebrity: First off, get a life. They can't touch you if you're out doing something interesting. ","Excess on occasion is exhilarating. It prevents moderation from acquiring the deadening effect of a habit. ","A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be. ","If a man does not make new acquaintances as he advances through life, he will soon find himself alone. A man should keep his friendships in constant repair. ","We don't receive wisdom; we must discover it for ourselves after a journey that no one can take for us or spare us. ","It seemed the world was divided into good and bad people. The good ones slept better... while the bad ones seemed to enjoy the waking hours much more. ","Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society. ","Silent gratitude isn't much use to anyone. ","If you wish success in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius. ","We inhereit from our ancestors gifts so often taken for granted... Each of us contains within... this inheritance of soul. We are links between the ages, containing past and present expectations, sacred memories and future promise. ","Ask advice only of your equals.

","The safest way to double your money is to fold it over and put it in your pocket. ","Everybody likes a kidder, but nobody lends him money. ","If you do not wish to be prone to anger, do not feed the habit; give it nothing which may tend to its increase. ","The man who backbites an absent friend, nay, who does not stand up for him when another blames him, the man who angles for bursts of laughter and for the repute of a wit, who can invent what he never saw, who cannot keep a secret - that man is black at heart: mark and avoid him. ","Worrying helps you some—it seems as if you were doing something when you're worrying. ","A good friend of my son's is a son to me. ","We are more ready to try the untried when what we do is inconsequential.  Hence the fact that many inventions had their birth as toys. ","That is what learning is. You suddenly understand something you've understood all your life, but in a new way. ","I am a Marxist--of the Groucho tendency. ","To have that sense of one's intrinsic worth... is potentially to have everything... ","Physicists like to think that all you have to do is say, these are the conditions, now what happens next?

","Most of the change we think we see in life is due to truths being in and out of favor. ","Doesn't matter what a person's name is as long as he behaves himself. ","I think that somehow, we learn who we really are and then live with that decision. ","Deeds, not words shall speak me. ","Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion... or you shall learn nothing. ","In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is stoned to death. ","A conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who, however, has never learned to walk forward. ","He who builds a better mousetrap these days runs into material shortages, patent-infringement suits, work stoppages, collusive bidding, discount discrimination--and taxes.\" ","There is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality. ","If you drink, don't drive. Don't even putt. ","Feel the fear and do it anyway. ","Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present. ","Self-development is a higher duty than self-sacrifice. ","The direct use of force is such a poor solution to any problem, it is generally employed only by small children and large nations.

","The trouble with lies was that once started, the fiction had to be continued, and it was hard always to be remembering details that you had made up upon the spur of the moment.

","Not going home is already like death. ","Everything you've learned in school as \"obvious\" becomes less and less obvious as you begin to study the universe.

","In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative original thinker unless you can also sell what you create. Management cannot be expected to recognize a good idea unless it is presented to them by a good salesman. ","He had heard people speak contemptuously of money: he wondered if they had ever tried to do without it. ","I am a kind of paranoiac in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy. ","Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed. ","You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war. ","Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought. ","I respect faith, but doubt is what gets you an education. ","You will find that the State is the kind of organization which, though it does big things badly, does small things badly, too. ","Oil prices have fallen lately. We include this news for the benefit of gas stations, which otherwise wouldn't learn of it for six months. ","Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It's splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world. ","Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are more pliable. ","We require from buildings, as from men, two kinds of goodness: first, the doing their practical duty well: then that they be graceful and pleasing in doing it; which last is itself another form of duty. ","It is always the best policy to speak the truth--unless, of course, you are an exceptionally good liar. ","Intimacy is what makes a marriage, not a ceremony, not a piece of paper from the state. ","Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment. ","Life is consciousness. ","At least half the mystery novels published violate the law that the solution, once revealed, must seem to be inevitable. ","When the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers. ","The world is not yet exhaused; let me see something tomorrow which I never saw before. ","A pound of pluck is worth a ton of luck. ","Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise. ","Adventure is just bad planning. ","Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you walk into an open sewer and die. ","Everyone is a prisoner of his own experiences. No one can eliminate prejudices - just recognize them. ","When a man takes one step toward God, God takes more steps toward that man than there are sands in the worlds of time. ","Why do you have to be a nonconformist like everybody else? ","Take away the miseries and you take away some folks' reason for living. ","Humor is the only test of gravity, and gravity of humor; for a subject which will not bear raillery is suspicious, and a jest which will not bear serious examination is false wit. ","The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance - it is the illusion of knowledge. ","One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar. ","I once wanted to become an atheist, but I gave up - they have no holidays. ","Eat before shopping. If you go to the store hungry, you are likely to make unnecessary purchases. ","Any clod can have the facts, but having opinions is an art. ","Genius begins great works; labor alone finishes them. ","I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world. ","The difference between a moral man and a man of honor is that the latter regrets a discreditable act, even when it has worked and he has not been caught. ","Have you heard that it was good to gain the day? I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won. ","It's no accident that the church and the graveyard stand side by side. The city of the dead sleeps encircled by the city of the living. ","We are rich only through what we give, and poor only through what we refuse. ","When I was a kid my parents moved a lot, but I always found them. ","Seek freedom and become captive of your desires, seek discipline and find your liberty. ","How do you define God? Like this. A God I could understand, at least potentially, was infinitely more interesting and relevant than one that defied comprehension. ","No great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought. ","We forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to be like other people. ","Whenever I hear, 'It can't be done,' I know I'm close to success. ","Weather forecast for tonight: dark. Continued dark overnight, with widely scattered light by morning. ","I haven't spoken to my wife in years. I didn't want to interrupt her. ","It seems to me that people have vast potential. Most people can do extraordinary things if they have the confidence or take the risks. Yet most people don't. They sit in front of the telly and treat life as if it goes on forever. ","Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony. ","Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be. ","Love is union with somebody, or something, outside oneself, under the condition of retaining the separateness and integrity of one's own self. ","The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that suits all cases. ","The really potent part of love is that it allows you to carry around beliefs about yourself that make you feel special, desirable, precious, innately good. Your lover couldn't have seen [these qualities] in you, even temporarily, if they weren't part of your essential being. ","Success is following the pattern of life one enjoys most. ","Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined. ","Realism...has no more to do with reality than anything else. ","Any piece of clothing can be sexy with a quietly passionate woman inside it. ","In what concerns you much, do not think that you have companions: know that you are alone in the world. ","Trying to be a first-rate reporter on the average American newspaper is like trying to play Bach's 'St. Matthew's Passion' on a ukulele. ","Since you are like no other being ever created since the beginning of time, you are incomparable. ","Most men are within a finger's breadth of being mad. ","If you greatly desire something, have the guts to stake everything on obtaining it. ","Dwell not upon thy weariness, thy strength shall be according to the measure of thy desire. ","To be always fortunate, and to pass through life with a soul that has never known sorrow, is to be ignorant of one half of nature. ","Old age is the most unexpected of things that can happen to a man. ","Beauty and seduction is nature's tool for survival, because we will protect what we love. ","It is not advisable, James, to venture unsolicited opinions. You should spare yourself the embarrassing discovery of their exact value to your listener. ","You see things; and you say, 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say, \"Why not?\" ","Let me advise thee not to talk of thyself as being old. There is something in Mind Cure, after all, and if thee continually talks of thyself as being old, thee may perhaps bring on some of the infirmities of age. At least I would not risk it if I were thee. ","An intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows. ","I tend to live in the past because most of my life is there. ","It's okay if you mess up. You should give yourself a break. ","In reality, serendipity accounts for one percent of the blessings we receive in life, work and love. The other 99 percent is due to our efforts. ","Naming one thing after another cannot, logically, increase the chances of the new thing turning out like the old thing. ","To sway an audience, you must watch them as you speak. ","Many people weigh the guilt they will feel against the pleasure of the forbidden action they want to take. ","We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics. They will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks to come. We've been asked to pause for a reality check; we've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope. ","You don't have to suffer to be a poet; adolescence is enough suffering for anyone. ","Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience. ","Ask not what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive... then go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. ","If you're hurting, you need to help somebody else ease their hurt. If you're in pain, help somebody else's pain. ","Self-control is not a problem in the future. It's only a problem NOW when the chocolates is next to us. ","If you can react the same way to winning and losing, that is a big accomplishment. That quality is important because it stays with you the rest of your life. ","No matter how rich you become, how famous or powerful, when you die the size of your funeral will still pretty much depend on the weather. ","I'm of the mind that even people who have limitations, if they have a curiosity, they will find a way to explore it. ","A fine quotation is a diamond on the finger of a man of wit, and a pebble in the hand of a fool. ","I think people don't place a high enough value on how much they are nurtured by doing whatever it is that totally absorbs them. ","Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up. ","Acquaintance, n.: A person whom we know well enough to borrow from, but not well enough to lend to. ","The human race is faced with a cruel choice: work or daytime television. ","My bounce-around life had taught me that dreams were dangerous things - they look solid in your mind, but you just try to reach for them. It's like gathering clouds. ","Level with your child by being honest. Nobody spots a phony quicker than a child. ","Not everything made you stronger. It was possible to survive, yet still be crippled for your trouble. Sometimes it was okay to run away, to skip the test, to chicken out. Or at least to get some help. ","Money's the same, whoever gives it to you. That was the point of money, after all: crisp and clean or wrinkled or disintegrated into quarters - a dollar was always worth a hundred cents. ","One day the factory sports coach, who was very strict, pointed at four boys, including me, and ordered us to run in a race. I protested that I was weak and not fit to run, but the coach sent me for a physical examination and the doctor said that I was perfectly well. So I had to run, and when I got started I felt I wanted to win. But I only came in second. That was the way it started. ","When a man plays a woman in a dress, you're halfway there. It's inherently funny. When a woman plays a man, for whatever reason, it's not that instant kind of funny. ","Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing. ","Be courteous to all, but intimate with few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation. ","My theory of evolution is that Darwin was adopted. ","Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper. ","The great thing about television is that if something important happens anywhere in the world, day or night, you can always change the channel. ","You never find yourself until you face the truth. ","Pain makes man think. Thought makes man wise. Wisdom makes life endurable. ","To know all is not to forgive all. It is to despise everybody. ","Great part of being a grownup, you never have to do anything. ","Good company and good discourse are the very sinews of virtue. ","It's about what YOU are going to do with the short time you have left on this earth. ","If you can solve your problem, then what is the need of worrying? If you cannot solve it, then what is the use of worrying? ","Keep five yards from a carriage, ten yards from a horse, and a hundred yards from an elephant; but the distance one should keep from a wicked man cannot be measured. ","Memory is a giggling sprite and will not be tamed. She takes flight the moment the present becomes the past. ","Every man serves a useful purpose: A miser, for example, makes a wonderful ancestor. ","It's wonderful what we can do if we're always doing. ","When someone allows you to bear his burdens, you have found deep friendship. ","This above all: to thine own self be true; And it must follow, as the night the day; Thou canst not then be false to any man. ","There are two ways of exerting one's strength: one is pushing down, the other is pulling up. ","Talent is nothing but a prolonged period of attention and shortened period of mental assimilation. ","In a networked world, trust is the most important currency. ","Words, once they are printed, have a life of their own. ","The great French Marshall Lyautey once asked his gardener to plant a tree. The gardener objected that the tree was slow growing and would not reach maturity for 100 years. The Marshall replied, 'In that case, there is no time to lose; plant it this afternoon!' ","If suffer we must, let's suffer on the heights. ","Communism is like one big phone company. ","What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. ","It is your work in life that is the ultimate seduction. ","The only paradise is paradise lost. ","The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes of mind. ","A myth is a religion in which no one any longer believes. ","I believe that if it were left to artists to choose their own labels, most would choose none. ","Education is a state-controlled manufactory of echoes. ","Good habits, which bring our lower passions and appetites under automatic control, leave our natures free to explore the larger experiences of life. ","I guess that's how death works. It doesn't matter if we're ready or not. It just happens. ","Nothing is impossible for the man who doesn't have to do it himself. ","Maps encourage boldness. They're like cryptic love letters. They make anything seem possible. ","Please write again soon. Though my own life is filled with activity, letters encourage momentary escape into others lives and I come back to my own with greater contentment. ","No man is exempt from saying silly things; the mischief is to say them deliberately. ","The best way to become acquainted with a subject is to write a book about it. ","Everybody likes to go their own way--to choose their own time and manner of devotion. ","But seduction isn’t making someone do what they don’t want to do. Seduction is enticing someone into doing what they secretly want to do already. ","A cynic is not merely one who reads bitter lessons from the past, he is one who is prematurely disappointed in the future. ","A person's abilities are tested best when defending rather than attacking. ","I shall never be ashamed of citing a bad author if the line is good. ","You cannot run away from a weakness; you must sometimes fight it out or perish. And if that be so, why not now, and where you stand? ","Don't get yourself arrested and make your day worse! If you need to vent, just smash something that's already broken! You can't get in trouble for wrecking the unsalvageable! ","Always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual. ","As we look deeply within, we understand our perfect balance. There is no fear of the cycle of birth, life and death. For when you stand in the present moment, you are timeless. ","In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice; In practice, there is. ","The best defence against misguided arrogance is a keen sense of humour. ","The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape... ","They certainly give very strange names to diseases. ","Even God cannot change the past. ","Promote yourself, but do not demote another. ","Luck is what you have left over after you give 100 percent. ","War is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the military. ","The whole world is in revolt. Soon there will be only five Kings left--the King of England, the King of Spades, The King of Clubs, the King of Hearts, and the King of Diamonds. ","He who will not economize will have to agonize. ","To be one's self, and unafraid whether right or wrong, is more admirable than the easy cowardice of surrender to conformity. ","War is a cowardly escape from the problems of peace. ","Artists who seek perfection in everything are those who cannot attain it in anything. ","Truth is what stands the test of experience. ","Man is asked to make of himself what he is supposed to become to fulfill his destiny. ","You cannot be mad at somebody who makes you laugh - it's as simple as that. ","Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut. ","To know oneself is to study oneself in action with another person. ","Better to write for yourself and have no public, than to write for the public and have no self. ","When you are right you cannot be too radical; when you are wrong, you cannot be too conservative. ","Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. ","In love, one and one are one. ","Laws are like sausages. It's better not to see them being made. ","The path to our destination is not always a straight one. We go down the wrong road, we get lost, we turn back. Maybe it doesn't matter which road we embark on. Maybe what matters is that we embark. ","Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work. ","Make money your god and it will plague you like the devil. ","When a thing is done, it's done. Don't look back. Look forward to your next objective. ","As a scientist, I am not sure anymore that life can be reduced to a class struggle, to dialectical materialism, or any set of formulas. Life is spontaneous and it is unpredictable, it is magical. I think that we have struggled so hard with the tangible that we have forgotten the intangible. ","Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value. ","Moments of kindness and reconciliation are worth having, even if the parting has to come sooner or later. ","In the end, everything is a gag. ","I have been truthful all along the way. The truth is more interesting, and if you tell the truth you never have to cover your tracks. ","The significance of man is that he is insignificant and is aware of it. ","The best way to live is by not knowing what will happen to you at the end of the day... ","Forget injuries, never forget kindnesses. ","It is hard to believe that a man is telling the truth when you know that you would lie if you were in his place. ","The person who makes a success of living is the one who see his goal steadily and aims for it unswervingly. That is dedication. ","The highest proof of virtue is to possess boundless power without abusing it. ","What you will do matters. All you need is to do it. ","The human brain is unique in that it is the only container of which it can be said that the more you put into it, the more it will hold. ","We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality. ","Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing. ","Anonymity is the truest expression of altruism. ","Running cross country is the closest man will ever get to flying. ","She used to drag her mattress besider her low window and lie awake for a long while, vibrating with excitement, as a machine vibrates from speed. Life rushed in upon her through that window - or so it seemed. In reality, of course, life rushes from within, not from without. There is no work of art so big or so beautiful that is was not once all contained in some youthful body, like this one which lay on the floor in the moonlight, pulsing with ardor and anticipation. ","Without freedom from the past, there is no freedom at all, because the mind is never new, fresh, innocent. ","Happiness is an imaginary condition, formerly attributed by the living to the dead, now usually attributed by adults to children, and by children to adults. ","By the work one knows the workmen. ","The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do. ","We do not write because we want to; we write because we have to. ","A doctor saves lives -- It's up to people to create lives that are worth saving. ","If living conditions don't stop improving in this country, we're going to run out of humble beginnings for our great men. ","I've been on a diet for two weeks and all I've lost is two weeks. ","The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best - and therefore never scrutinize or question. ","Happiness is not a station you arrive at, but a manner of traveling. ","We're not lost. We're locationally challenged. ","Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much. ","Truth has beauty, power and necessity. ","It is not always the same thing to be a good man and a good citizen. ","There is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well being without proper darkness. ","Iron rusts from disuse; stagnant water loses its purity and in cold weather becomes frozen; even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind. ","You wake me up early in the morning to tell me I am right? Please wait until I am wrong. ","Anything you could ever want or be you already have and are. ","In heaven all the interesting people are missing. ","When I pass, speak freely of my shortcomings and my flaws. Learn from them, for I'll have no ego to injure. ","You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, hopefulness, or even despairâ€“the sense that you can never completely put on the page whatâ€™s in your mind and heart. You can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down names. You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page. ","The only thing worse than a man you can't control is a man you can. ","Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. ","Let a good man do good deeds with the same zeal that the evil man does bad ones. ","Good ideas are not adopted automatically. They must be driven into practice with courageous patience. ","Flying may not be all plain sailing, but the fun of it is worth the price. ","It is impossible to imagine Goethe or Beethoven being good at billiards or golf. ","A kleptomaniac is a person who helps himself because he can't help himself. ","Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul alike. ","If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them. ","Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that's the stuff life is made of. ","There are some defeats more triumphant than victories. ","All things must change to something new, to something strange. ","Anyone can do any amount of work provided it isn't the work he is supposed to be doing at the moment. ","I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. ","Disconnecting from change does not recapture the past. It loses the future. ","Slap a mask on a drunk and you're going to have trouble. It's like having a live reenactment of anonymous forum comments. ","You have to be careful who you let define your good. ","If writers stopped writing about what happened to them, then there would be a lot of empty pages. ","Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters. ","We all have strength enough to endure the misfortunes of others. ","One kernel is felt in a hogshead; one drop of water helps to swell the ocean; a spark of fire helps to give light to the world. None are too small, too feeble, too poor to be of service. Think of this and act. ","When there is no peril in the fight there is no glory in the triumph. ","Special-interest publications should realize that if they are attracting enough advertising and readers to make a profit, the interest is not so special. ","If you wish in this world to advance, your merits you're bound to enhance; You must stir it and stump it, and blow your own trumpet, or trust me, you haven't a chance. ","I have always thought the actions of men the best interpreters of their thoughts. ","Be on the alert to recognize your prime at whatever time of your life it may occur. ","You never know till you try to reach them how accessible men are; but you must approach each man by the right door. ","No matter how advanced your camera you still need to be responsible for getting it to the right place at the right time and pointing it in the right direction to get the photo you want. ","Take rest; a field that has rested gives a bountiful crop. ","The rule is perfect: in all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane. ","My idea of good company is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company. ","Sometimes it's good to contrast what you like with something else. It makes you appreciate it even more. ","I have never let my schooling interfere with my education. ","Do not envy a sinner; you don't know what disaster awaits him. ","The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word 'crisis.' One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger - but recognize the opportunity. ","So divinely is the world organized that every one of us, in our place and time, is in balance with everything else. ","You can talk about anything if you go about it the right way, which is never malicious. ","The place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one, particularly if he plays golf. ","I believe that one of life's greatest risks is never daring to risk. ","There's something fundamental you have to understand about yourself before you can change your life for good. ","The world is full of people whose notion of a satisfactory future is, in fact, a return to the idealised past. ","Laugh at yourself first, before anyone else can. ","Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information, or...of something else. ","One is obliged to do a great deal of kissing in my line of work: air kissing, [butt] kissing, kissing up, and of course actual kissing. Much like hookers, actors have to do it with people we may not like or even know. ","It is often merely for an excuse that we say things are impossible. ","Remember that fear always lurks behind perfectionism. Confronting your fears and allowing yourself the right to be human can, paradoxically, make you a far happier and more productive person. ","Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it. ","I can't understand why a person will take a year to write a novel when he can easily buy one for a few dollars. ","The end result of kindness is that it draws people to you. ","In politics you must always keep running with the pack. The moment that you falter and they sense that you are injured, the rest will turn on you like wolves. ","Never eat more than you can lift. ","Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. ","Language most shews a man: Speak, that I may see thee. ","It is all very well, when the pen flows, but then there are the dark days when imagination deserts one, and it is an effort to put anything down on paper. That little you have achieved stares at you at the end of the day, and you know the next morning you will have to scrape it down and start again. ","I live in the present due to the constraints of the Space-Time Continuum. ","If men saw that a term was set to their troubles, they would find strength in some way to withstand the hocus-pocus and intimidations of the prophets. ","To resist the frigidity of old age one must combine the body, the mind and the heart - and to keep them in parallel vigor one must exercise, study and love. ","Why do writers write? Because it isn't there. ","God help those who do not help themselves. ","Who is wise? He that learns from every One. Who is powerful? He that governs his Passions. Who is rich? He that is content. Who is that? Nobody. ","Mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true. ","In an industrial society which confuses work and productivity, the necessity of producing has always been an enemy of the desire to create. ","A man travels the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it. ","A fact is a simple statement that everyone believes. It is innocent, unless found guilty. A hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe. It is guilty, until found effective. ","Never take the advice of someone who has not had your kind of trouble. ","What makes the engine go? Desire, desire, desire. ","A verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's written on. ","She makes me love her and I like people who make me love them. It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them. ","Somebody once asked me if I have anything like faith, and I said I have faith in the narrative. I have a belief in a narrative that is bigger than me, that is alive and I trust will work itself out. ","A bookstore is one of the only pieces of evidence we have that people are still thinking. ","A timid person is frightened before a danger, a coward during the time, and a courageous person afterward. ","I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves. ","If Pac-Man had affected us as kids, we'd all be running around in dark rooms, munching pills and listening to repetitive electronic music. ","The love of learning, the sequestered nooks, And all the sweet serenity of books. ","Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture. ","You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do. ","I don't make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts. ","The discovery of a new dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a new star. ","The things we know best are the things we haven't been taught. ","The trouble with jogging is that the ice falls out of your glass. ","The moral virtues, then, are produced in us neither by nature nor against nature. Nature, indeed, prepares in us the ground for their reception, but their complete formation is the product of habit. ","Help others get ahead. You will always stand taller with someone else on your shoulders. ","Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy. ","Everyone is born with genius, but most people only keep it a few minutes. ","Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for. ","Think twice before you speak, and then you may be able to say something more insulting than if you spoke right out at once. ","There is no pleasure in having nothing to do; the fun is in having lots to do and not doing it. ","The only reason I made a commercial for American Express was to pay for my American Express bill. ","Nostalgia is a side effect of dying. ","I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't think you can measure life in terms of years. I think longevity doesn't necessarily have anything to do with happiness. I mean happiness comes from facing challenges and going out on a limb and taking risks. If you're not willing to take a risk for something you really care about, you might as well be dead. ","Getting caught is the mother of invention. ","What is written without effort is in general read without pleasure. ","Properly, we should read for power. Man reading should be man intensely alive. The book should be a ball of light in one's hand. ","Derive happiness in oneself from a good day's work, from illuminating the fog that surrounds us. ","You don't need to outdo the competition. It's expensive and defensive. Underdo your competition. We need more simplicity and clarity. ","He makes people pleased with him by making them first pleased with themselves. ","Make yourself necessary to somebody. Do not make life hard to any. ","So we went to Atari and said, 'Hey, we've got this amazing thing, even built with some of your parts, and what do you think about funding us? Or we'll give it to you. We just want to do it. Pay our salary, we'll come work for you.' And they said, 'No.' So then we went to Hewlett-Packard, and they said, 'Hey, we don't need you. You haven't got through college yet.' ","Angels dancing on the head of a pin dissolve into nothingness at the bedside of a dying child. ","Have more than thou showest; Speak less than thou knowest. ","He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it. ","Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose. ","Ever tried? Ever failed? No Matter, try again, fail again, Fail better. ","Silence is golden when you can't think of a good answer. ","A woman can forgive a man for the harm he does her...but she can never forgive him for the sacrifices he makes on her account. ","Happiness makes up in height for what it lacks in length. ","To the soul, there is hardly anything more healing than friendship. ","You may delay, but time will not. ","Abuse a man unjustly, and you will make friends for him. ","One of the lessons of history is that nothing is often a good thing to do and always a clever thing to say. ","Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love. ","Inside myself is a place where I live all alone and that's where you renew your springs that never dry up. ","Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one's values.

","Never tell anyone that you're writing a book, going on a diet, exercising, taking a course, or quitting smoking. They'll encourage you to death. ","I show up. I listen. I try to laugh. ","You cannot go around and keep score. If you keep score on the good things and the bad things, you'll find out that you're a very miserable person.

","If I've learned one thing in the 14 years I've been a full-time cartoonist, it's that you can not let anyone else define your professionalism.

And this has happened to me ever since I was a girl, when I was flat, had no teeth, was skinny and small as I could be. I always got more attention than anyone else. If I hadn't, I would have made sure I did. ","Everything we do really is just a little marker on the long road to death. And sometimes that's overwhelmingly depressing to me, and sometimes it makes me feel kinship and forgiveness. We've all got the same ending to the story. The way we make that story more elaborate, I got to respect. ","For every person who wants to teach there are approximately thirty people who don't want to learn--much. ","Those little nimble musicians of the air, that warble forth their curious ditties, with which nature hath furnished them to the shame of art. ","Dreams that do come true can be as unsettling as those that don't. ","That's the thing about needs. Sometimes, when you get them met, you don't need them anymore.

","Choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to form of mental agoraphobia and that brings its own terrors. I think the willfully unimaginative see more monsters, they are often more afraid. What is more, those who choose not to empathize enable real monsters. For without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude through our own apathy. ","The future will be better tomorrow. ","The one thing more difficult than following a regimen is not imposing it on others. ","The man who says he is willing to meet you halfway is usually a poor judge of distance. ","Famous I don't know about. It's hard to be famous and alive. I just want to play music every day and hear someone say, 'Thanks, that was great, here's some money, same time tomorrow, okay?' ","Politeness and consideration for others is like investing pennies and getting dollars back. ","When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen. ","Money can't buy friends, but it can get you a better class of enemy. ","Forsake not an old friend; for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink it with pleasure. ","Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. ","If you would marry suitably, marry your equal. ","Honest criticism is hard to take, particularly from a relative, a friend, an acquaintance, or a stranger. ","Fallacies do not cease to be fallacies because they become fashions.

","The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.

","Write a wise saying and your name will live forever. ","The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves. ","Give me the luxuries of life and I will willingly do without the necessities. ","Anyone can lose a few pounds, but not everyone has the tools to stick with it. ","The Constitution gives every American the inalienable right to make a damn fool of himself. ","Learn to value yourself, which means: to fight for your happiness. ","War is not its own end, except in some catastrophic slide into absolute damnation. It's peace that's wanted.

","You never lose a dream. It just incubates as a hobby. ","We can draw lessons from the past, but we cannot live in it. ","Sometimes it is harder to deprive oneself of a pain than of a pleasure. ","It is unwise to be too sure of one's own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err. ","Sometimes people are layered like that. There's something totally different underneath than what's on the surface. But sometimes, there's a third, even deeper level, and that one is the same as the top surface one. Like with pie. ","Painting in watercolor is like walking a tight-rope; one must achieve a perfect balance between what the paint wants to do and what the artist wants to do, or all is lost. ","It is best to do things systematically, since we are only human, and disorder is our worst enemy. ","Far from idleness being the root of all evil, it is rather the only true good. ","Mama exhorted her children at every opportunity to 'jump at de sun.' We might not land on the sun, but at least we would get off the ground. ","No one who cannot rejoice in the discovery of his own mistakes deserves to be called a scholar. ","I still need more healthy rest in order to work at my best.

","For most of history, Anonymous was a woman. ","When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on. ","I'm not afraid of facts, I welcome facts but a congeries of facts is not equivalent to an idea. This is the essential fallacy of the so-called \"scientific\" mind. People who mistake facts for ideas are incomplete thinkers; they are gossips. ","It was on my fifth birthday that Papa put his hand on my shoulder and said, 'Remember, my son, if you ever need a helping hand, you'll find one at the end of your arm.'

","I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours. ","It is hard work, but there is happiness in it. ","I like living. I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing. ","Work is the curse of the drinking classes. ","Life is tough, and if you have the ability to laugh at it you have the ability to enjoy it. ","Stamina is utterly important. And stamina is only possible if it's managed well. People think all they need to do is endure one crazy, intense, job-free creative burst and their dreams will come true.

Farnsworth, inventor of television, we'd still be eating frozen radio dinners. ","There is... nothing greater than touching the shore after crossing some great body of water knowing that I've done it with my own two arms and legs. ","I wish you sunshine on your path and storms to season your journey. I wish you peace in the world in which you live... More I cannot wish you except perhaps love to make all the rest worthwhile. ","Thought: Why does man kill? He kills for food. And not only food: frequently there must be a beverage. ","If you are capable people are happy to play with you. ","As I was walking up the stair  I met a man who wasn't there.  He wasn't there again today.  I wish, I wish he'd stay away. ","Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. ","Rumor travels faster, but it don't stay put as long as truth. ","One must know oneself, if this does not serve to discover truth, it at least serves as a rule of life and there is nothing better. ","We're a sentimental people. We like a few kind words better than millions of dollars given in a humiliating way. ","Language is the source of misunderstandings. ","I don't mind what language an opera is sung in so long as it is a language I don't understand. ","Those who can laugh without cause have either found the true meaning of happiness or have gone stark raving mad. ","The man who lets himself be bored is even more contemptible than the bore.

","The lessons this life has planted in my heart pertain more to caring than crops, more to Golden Rule than gold, more to the proper choice than to the popular choice. ","Could we change our attitude, we should not only see life differently, but life itself would come to be different.

If you have that drive, passion, and commitment, there is no way you won’t get there. ","I started concentrating so hard on my vision that I lost sight. ","Remember that nobody will ever get ahead of you as long as he is kicking you in the seat of the pants. ","Be sure that it is not you that is mortal, but only your body.

","What is an epigram? A dwarfish whole, its body brevity, and wit its soul. ","I deal with stress in two ways because there are two kinds of stress. There's stress that you can take care of and there's stress that you can't. The first one, I take care of it as fast as possible, because putting it off always makes it worse. Things that I can't fix? I think about the fact that I can't fix them.

","Easy enough to dismiss others' problems when you had none of your own. ","His mother should have thrown him away and kept the stork. ","Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence.  Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.  Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.  Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.

","People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances.

","Thirty-five is a very attractive age. London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years.

","Some cupid kills with arrows, some with traps. ","Nothing's so apt to undermine your confidence in a product as knowing that the commercial selling it has been approved by the company that make it. ","The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be sharing the adventure with them. ","Ambition is a poor excuse for not having sense enough to be lazy. ","Everything I did in my life that was worthwhile I caught hell for. ","I hate life, I hate death and everything in between just doesn't interest me. ","It has been my experience that one cannot, in any shape or form, depend on human relations for lasting reward. It is only work that truly satisfies. ","We are here on Earth to do good to others.

But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you? ","A judge is a law student who marks his own examination papers. ","Dreams are postcards from our subconscious, inner self to outer self, right brain trying to cross that moat to the left.

","When you don't share your problems, you resent hearing the problems of other people. ","I know starting careers in troubled times is a challenge, but it is also a privilege. Because it's moments like these that force us to try harder, dig deeper and to discover gifts we never knew we had. To find the greatness that lies within each of us. So don't ever shy away from that endeavor. Don't stop adding to your body of work. I can promise that you will be the better for that continued effort as will be this nation that we all love.

","Human salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted. ","It's so much easier to suggest solutions when you don't know too much about the problem.

","The wisest mind has something yet to learn. ","Never expose yourself unnecessarily to danger; a miracle may not save you...and if it does, it will be deducted from your share of luck or merit. ","That is the saving grace of humor, if you fail no one is laughing at you. ","If a thing isn't worth saying, you sing it. ","Having once decided to achieve a certain task, achieve it at all costs of tedium and distaste. The gain in self-confidence of having accomplished a tiresome labor is immense. ","While one person hesitates because he feels inferior, the other is busy making mistakes and becoming superior. ","Whatever God's dream about man may be, it seems certain it cannot come true unless man cooperates. ","I do nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take thought for your persons or your properties, but and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given by money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public as well as private. This is my teaching, and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth, I am a mischievous person. ","I'd give my right arm to be ambidextrous. ","The strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless he transforms strength into right, and obedience into duty. ","The enthusiasm of a woman's love is even beyond the biographer's. ","When a stupid man is doing something he is ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty. ","Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice. ","Each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem. ","In the fight between you and the world, back the world.

","The folly of mistaking a paradox for a discovery, a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself for an oracle, is inborn in us. ","A bore is a man who deprives you of solitude without providing you with company. ","When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who made a difference in this world. My hope still is to leave the world a little bit better for my having been here. It's a wonderful life and I love it. ","Success is meaningless if you can't sleep at night because of harsh things said, petty secrets sharpened against hard and stony regret, just waiting to be plunged into the soft underbelly of a 'friendship.' ","What's done cannot be undone. ","It is the letter not sent that is often the most valuable. ","He that will not sail until all dangers are over, will never put to sea. ","You have to find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient time, nor do they last long. ","Deal with the consequences of your actions, 'cause life ain't no video game. ","Reality continues to ruin my life. ","How soon was it that the dead are brought to deity in the eyes of those who in life found them little regard. ","Grasp the subject, the words will follow. ","All that counts in life is intention.

","You always pass failure on the way to success. ","Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps, for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are and what they ought to be. ","An ostentatious man will rather relate a blunder or an absurdity he has committed, than be debarred from talking of his own dear person. ","The significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them. ","I find it rather easy to portray a businessman.

","Democracy is a device that ensures we shall be governed no better than we deserve. ","And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in everything. ","The best way to keep one's word is not to give it. ","We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be. ","Mighty hard to tell the people you love you're a failure. ","I would rather be a coward than brave because people hurt you when you are brave. ","When we ask for advice, we are usually looking for an accomplice. ","I can't criticize what I don't understand.

","Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and, therefore, the foundation of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and relevetory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared. ","No tyranny is so irksome as petty tyranny: the officious demands of policemen, government clerks, and electromechanical gadgets.

I cannot be dictated to by a watch. ","Simplicity is the peak of civilization. ","I'm never going to be famous. My name will never be writ large on the roster of Those Who Do Things. I don't do any thing. Not one single thing. I used to bite my nails, but I don't even do that any more. ","We need men who can dream of things that never were. ","Sometimes I worry about being a success in a mediocre world. ","A little drama wins more friends than boring. ","Joy is prayer - Joy is strength - Joy is love - Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. ","First it is necessary to stand on your own two feet. But the minute a man finds himself in that position, the next thing he should do is reach out his arms. ","Success is really about being ready for the good opportunities that come before you. It's not to have a detailed plan of everything that you're going to do. You can't plan innovation or inspiration, but you can be ready for it, and when you see it, you can jump on it. ","Eternity's a terrible thought. I mean, where's it all going to end? ","Keep your fears to yourself, but share your courage with others. ","The great art of giving consists in this: the gift should cost very little and yet be greatly coveted, so that it may be the more highly appreciated. ","The strongest man in the world is he who stands alone. ","Every man, wherever he goes, is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions, which move with him like flies on a summer day. ","One man may hit the mark, another blunder; but heed not these distinctions. Only from the alliance of the one, working with and through the other, are great things born. ","Ninety percent of everything is crap. ","An intellectual is a person who has discovered something more interesting than sex. ","Don't let us make imaginary evils, when you know we have so many real ones to encounter. ","It's noble to want to confess, but if the results are just damage and pain, that's not noble. It's selfish. ","I like an escalator because an escalator can never break, it can only become stairs. There would never be an escalator temporarily out of order sign, only an escalator temporarily stairs. Sorry for the convenience. ","I value my garden more for being full of blackbirds than of cherries, and very frankly give them fruit for their songs. ","Seeing ourselves as others see us would probably confirm our worst suspicions about them. ","Abraham Lincoln and Millard Fillmore had the same title. They were both presidents of the United States, but their tenure in office and their legacy could not be more different. ","Mustard's no good without roast beef. ","It may make your blood boil and your mind may not be changed, but the practice of listening to opposing views is essential for effective citizenship. It is essential for our democracy. ","A God that can be understood is no God. Who can explain the Infinite in words?

Were it otherwise he would never have been able to find those words. ","Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to get leisure. ","A thing worth having is a thing worth cheating for. ","Never trouble another for what you can do for yourself. ","Two men look out through the same bars: One sees the mud and one the stars. ","Cynicism is an unpleasant way of saying the truth. ","We spend most of our time and energy in a kind of horizontal thinking. We move along the surface of things [but] there are times when we stop. We sit still. We lose ourselves in a pile of leaves or its memory. We listen and breezes from a whole other world begin to whisper. ","True friends are those who really know you but love you anyway. ","Enjoyment is not a goal, it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity. ","The people who are regarded as moral luminaries are those who forego ordinary pleasures themselves and find compensation in interfering with the pleasures of others. ","The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes. ","One is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.

","The only thing I like about rich people is their money. ","I have the consolation of having added nothing to my private fortune during my public service, and of retiring with hands clean as they are empty. ","Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently. For in the very torrent, tempest, and as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. ","Moral indignation is jealousy with a halo. ","Ask me no reason why I love you; for though Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him not for his counsellor. ","The best of us must sometimes eat our words. ","USA Today has come out with a new survey - apparently, three out of every four people make up 75% of the population. ","Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age. ","Look wise, say nothing, and grunt. Speech was given to conceal thought. ","I know God will not give me anything I can't handle. I just wish that He didn't trust me so much. ","Never hold discussions with the monkey when the organ grinder is in the room. ","Wine makes a man more pleased with himself; I do not say that it makes him more pleasing to others. ","Music with dinner is an insult both to the cook and the violinist. ","I thought about how wonderfully strange it would be to live in a place where almost everything had been built by the dead. ","Let the fear of danger be a spur to prevent it; he that fears not, gives advantage to the danger. ","He that respects himself is safe from others. He wears a coat of mail that none can pierce. ","Broadly speaking, the short words are the best, and the old words best of all. ","All the world's a cage. ","Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle. ","What luck for rulers that men do not think. ","Heirlooms we don't have in our family. But stories we've got. ","Our imagination is the only limit to what we can hope to have in the future. ","Is love supposed to last throughout all time, or is it like trains changing at random stops. If I loved her, how could I leave her? If I felt that way then, how come I don't feel anything now? ","The forceps of our minds are clumsy forceps, and crush the truth a little in taking hold of it. ","People ask for criticism, but they only want praise. ","My theology, briefly, is that the universe was dictated but not signed. ","Computer games don't affect kids, I mean if Pac Man affected us as kids, we'd all be running around in darkened rooms, munching pills and listening to repetitive music. ","An undefined problem has an infinite number of solutions. ","Try to learn something about everything and everything about something. ","A strong conviction that something must be done is the parent of many bad measures. ","What helps luck is a habit of watching for opportunities, of having a patient, but restless mind, of sacrificing one's ease or vanity, of uniting a love of detail to foresight, and of passing through hard times bravely and cheerfully. ","To be alone is to be different, to be different is to be alone. ","You cannot acquire experience by making experiments. You cannot create experience. You must undergo it. ","Gratitude is our most direct line to God and the angels. If we take the time, no matter how crazy and troubled we feel, we can find something to be thankful for.  ","Yes is how you get your first job, and your next job, and your spouse, and even your kids. Even if it's a bit edgy, a bit out of your comfort zone, saying yes means that you will do something new, meet someone new and make a difference. ","There was a disturbance in my heart, a voice that spoke there and said, I want, I want, I want! It happened every afternoon, and when I tried to suppress it it got even stronger. ","Passion kept one fully in the present, so that time became a series of mutually exclusive 'nows.' ","There is only one way to defeat the enemy, and that is to write as well as one can. The best argument is an undeniably good book. ","Honesty is the best policy - when there is money in it. ","It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.

","Most people ignore most poetry  because  most poetry ignores most people. ","That's the thing about being a former fat camp champ: when asked if I'd change my past if I could, I always answer no. The pain of being an overweight kid, the humiliation, make you think twice before ever cutting anyone else down. ","You know what's interesting about Washington? It's the kind of place where second-guessing has become second nature. ","To my embarrassment I was born in bed with a lady. ","Time is on the side of the oppressed today, it's against the oppressor. Truth is on the side of the oppressed today, it's against the oppressor. You don't need anything else.

","Happiness arises in a state of peace, not of tumult. ","I have never taken any exercise except sleeping and resting. ","I hate women because they always know where things are.

","Too many have dispensed with generosity in order to practice charity. ","Books to the ceiling, Books to the sky, My pile of books is a mile high. How I love them! How I need them! I'll have a long beard by the time I read them. ","If I were two-faced, would I be wearing this one? ","Love the moment, and the energy of that moment will spread beyond all boundaries. ","You see what power is - holding someone else's fear in your hand and showing it to them! ","She did not talk to people as if they were strange hard shells she had to crack open to get inside.

","It is well to give when asked but it is better to give unasked, through understanding. ","The place where optimism most flourishes is the lunatic asylum. ","There is no reciprocity. Men love women, women love children, children love hamsters.

","You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you. ","No one has a finer command of language than the person who keeps his mouth shut. ","Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some hire public relations officers. ","Everything is funny as long as it is happening to Somebody Else. ","We should every night call ourselves to an account; What infirmity have I mastered today? What passions opposed? What temptation resisted? What virtue acquired? Our vices will abort of themselves if they be brought every day to the shrift. ","Pleasure is a by-product of doing something that is worth doing. Therefore, do not seek pleasure as such. Pleasure comes of seeking something else, and comes by the way. ","We can't all be heroes because somebody has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by.

","I never put on a pair of shoes until I've worn them at least five years. ","A sense of duty is useful in work, but offensive in personal relations. People wish to be liked, not be endured with patient resignation. ","If we value the pursuit of knowledge, we must be free to follow wherever that search may lead us. The free mind is not a barking dog, to be tethered on a ten-foot chain. ","Whatever you are, be a good one. ","Good judgement comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgement. ","Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. ","It does not seem to be true that work necessarily needs to be unpleasant. It may always have to be hard, or at least harder than doing nothing at all. But there is ample evidence that work can be enjoyable, and that indeed, it is often the most enjoyable part of life. ","[Not smoking the cigarette is] a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don’t give it the power to do its killing. ","This is pretty much what journals are all about, at least to me. I knew as I wrote them that even though they provided an excellent place for brain (and heart, and psyche) dump, they were mainly a map of me. ","Nobody is ever met at the airport when beginning a new adventure. It's just not done. ","Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone; but if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery. ","Writers should be read, but neither seen nor heard. ","We're actors - we're the opposite of people. ","To be a saint is the exception; to be upright is the rule. Err, falter, sin, but be upright. To commit the least possible sin is the law for man.

","Often it does seem a pity that Noah and his party did not miss the boat. ","True happiness... arises, in the first place, from the enjoyment of one's self. ","Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously.... Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us. ","I like coincidences. They make me wonder about destiny, and whether free will is an illusion or just a matter of perspective. They let me speculate on the idea of some master plan that, from time to time, we're allowed to see out of the corner of our eye. ","Every artist was first an amateur. ","The cure for writer's cramp is writer's block. ","A brand for a company is like a reputation for a person. You earn reputation by trying to do hard things well. ","Whenever I hear anyone arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally. ","We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others that in the end we become disguised to ourselves. ","We only do well the things we like doing. ","The only way to entertain some folks is to listen to them. ","On the plus side, death is one of the few things that can be done just as easily lying down. ","Always be a little kinder than necessary. ","Nothing is really work unless you would rather be doing something else. ","We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real? ","Any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have. ","I am convinced that life in a physical body is meant to be an ecstatic experience. ","Blessed are those who can give without remembering, and take without forgetting. ","My favorite animal is steak. ","The radical of one century is the conservative of the next. The radical invents the views. When he has worn them out the conservative adopts them. ","Real, constructive mental power lies in the creative thought that shapes your destiny, and your hour-by-hour mental conduct produces power for change in your life. Develop a train of thought on which to ride. The nobility of your life as well as your happiness depends upon the direction in which that train of thought is going. ","It never pays to deal with the flyweights of the world. They take far too much pleasure in thwarting you at every turn. ","The leaders we revere and the businesses that last are generally not the result of a narrow pursuit of popularity or personal advancement, but of devotion to some bigger purpose. That's the hallmark of real success. The other trapping of success might be the by product of this larger mission, but it can't be the central thing. ","Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago. ","Examine what is said, not him who speaks. ","Millions long for immortality who don't know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon. ","Get all the fools on your side and you can be elected to anything. ","Health is not valued till sickness comes. ","Only exceptionally rational men can afford to be absurd. ","I believe that professional wrestling is clean and everything else in the world is fixed. ","[The body is] a marvelous machine...a chemical laboratory, a power-house. Every movement, voluntary or involuntary, full of secrets and marvels! ","I never guess. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. ","I seek constantly to improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar to which all are attracted. ","It is easier to stay out than get out. ","In the end, I decide that the mark we've left on each other is the color and shape of love. That the unfinished business between us. Because love, love is never finished. It circles and circles, the memories out of order and not always complete. ","Sometimes people are on the outside looking in because they don’t have any money. But sometimes people are on the outside looking in because they don’t have any class. ","My theory is that if you look confident you can pull off anything - even if you have no clue what you're doing. ","Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. ","If you don't run your own life, somebody else will. ","Anyone who has gumption knows what it is, and anyone who hasn't can never know what it is. So there is no need of defining it. ","I do not regret one professional enemy I have made. Any actor who doesn't dare to make an enemy should get out of the business. ","It is hard to fight an enemy who has outposts in your head. ","Now I know what a statesman is; he's a dead politician. We need more statesmen. ","With a stop light, green means 'go' and yellow means 'slow down'. With a banana, however, it is quite the opposite. Yellow means 'go', green means 'whoa, slow down', and red means 'where the heck did you get that banana?' ","I'm going to memorize your name and throw my head away. ","I don't own a cell phone or a pager. I just hang around everyone I know, all the time. If someone wants to get a hold of me, they just say 'Mitch,' and I say 'what?' and turn my head slightly. ","I love Mickey Mouse more than any woman I've ever known. ","Poetry often enters through the window of irrelevance. ","See, that's all you're thinking about, is winning. You're confirming your sense of self- worth through outward reward instead of through inner appreciation.

","None but a coward dares to boast that he has never known fear. ","For visions come not to polluted eyes.

","If you want to make peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies. ","Most of the basic truths of life sound absurd at first hearing. ","Dying is a very dull, dreary affair.

","I have learned that to be with those I like is enough. ","An expert is a person who avoids small error as he sweeps on to the grand fallacy. ","To love deeply in one direction makes us more loving in all others. ","Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities. ","It is better to suffer wrong than to do it, and happier to be sometimes cheated than not to trust. ","Facts are stupid things. ","Against stupidity the gods themselves contend in vain. ","Virtue is choked with foul ambition. ","Not even computers will replace committees, because committees buy computers. ","There is hopeful symbolism in the fact that flags do not wave in a vacuum. ","No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

","My definition of an expert in any field is a person who knows enough about what's really going on to be scared. ","I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be. ","That is not what Geek means to me.

","Honesty pays, but it doesn't seem to pay enough to suit some people. ","Besides the noble art of getting things done, there is a nobler art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of nonessentials. ","Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all. ","Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crackpot' than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost. ","We need anything politically important rationed out like Pez: small, sweet, and coming out of a funny, plastic head. ","Living apart and at peace with myself, I came to realize more vividly the meaning of the doctrine of acceptance. To refrain from giving advice, to refrain from meddling in the affairs of others, to refrain, even though the motives be the highest, from tampering with another's way of life - so simple, yet so difficult for an active spirit. Hands off! ","All men profess honesty as long as they can. To believe all men honest would be folly. To believe none so is something worse.

","The word 'politics' is derived from the word 'poly', meaning 'many', and the word 'ticks', meaning 'blood sucking parasites'.

","Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. ","Some national parks have long waiting lists for camping reservations. When you have to wait a year to sleep next to a tree, something is wrong. ","Retribution often means that we eventually do to ourselves what we have done unto others. ","To err is human--and to blame it on a computer is even more so. ","The thing women have got to learn is that nobody gives you power. You just take it. ","To flatter and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of half enjoyment.

","One man's folly is another man's wife. ","May your service of love a beautiful thing; want nothing else, fear nothing else and let love be free to become what love truly is. ","Wisdom is knowing what to do next; virtue is doing it. ","My momma always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.

","The louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons. ","The key to being a good manager is keeping the people who hate me away from those who are still undecided. ","In democracy it's your vote that counts; In feudalism it's your count that votes. ","Rest satisfied with doing well, and leave others to talk of you as they please. ","If there is one thing worse than being an ugly duckling in a house of swans, it's having the swans pretend there's no difference. ","When love is gone, there's always justice. And when justice is gone, there's always force. And when force is gone, there's always Mom. Hi, Mom! ","The biggest thing [Frida] brought into my life was this peacefulness. I still get passionate about things, but my passion is not so scattered and it's not needy. It's a lot more powerful because it comes with this groundedness and peacefulness. That it's about the process, not about the results. ","Rest is the sweet sauce of labor. ","Wisdom doesn't automatically come with old age. Nothing does - except wrinkles. It's true, some wines improve with age. But only if the grapes were good in the first place. ","A mind set in its ways is wasted. Don't do it. ","It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper. ","Take hold lightly; let go lightly.

","The stupid neither forgive nor forget; the naive forgive and forget; the wise forgive but do not forget. ","The way we see the problem is the problem. ","A tactical retreat is not a bad response to a surprise assault, you know. First you survive. Then you choose your own ground. Then you counterattack. ","We are like a bunch of dogs squirting on fire hydrants. We poison the groundwater with our toxic piss, marking everything MINE in a ridiculous attempt to survive our deaths. ","True repentance means making amends with the person when at all possible. ","If all the world's a stage, I want to operate the trap door. ","The goal isn’t to make something everyone will love; the goal is to get excited, and make a thing where something wasn’t before.

This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended. ","I've always tried to go a step past wherever people expected me to end up. ","One picture is worth a thousand words. ","Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae. ","Change happens by listening and then starting a dialogue with the people who are doing something you don't believe is right. ","The real power behind whatever success I have now was something I found within myself - something that's in all of us, I think, a little piece of God just waiting to be discovered. ","In everyone's heart stirs a great homesickness. ","Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance. ","No matter how far you travel or how much you run from it, can you ever really escape your past? ","When you appeal to force, there's one thing you must never do - lose. ","America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this. ","Rock journalism is people who can't write interviewing people who can't talk for people who can't read. ","Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted. ","Nothing is so awesomely unfamiliar as the familiar that discloses itself at the end of a journey.

","A runners creed: I will win; if I cannot win, I shall be second; if I cannot be second, I shall be third; if I cannot place at all, I shall still do my best. ","Doing a thing well is often a waste of time. ","It's sad when our daddies die. Makes us one less person inside. ","I look at what the phone company does and do the opposite. ","All generalizations are dangerous, even this one. ","To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all. ","If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else. ","Privacy and security are those things you give up when you show the world what makes you extraordinary.

","I've decided that the key to happiness is low expectations. ","When you're a team of one, you're always captain. ","The body is an instrument, the mind its function, the witness and reward of its operation. ","Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense. ","Minds, like bodies, will often fall into a pimpled, ill-conditioned state from mere excess of comfort. ","What I look forward to is continued immaturity followed by death. ","Politics is not a bad profession. If you succeed there are many rewards, if you disgrace yourself you can always write a book. ","Honesty is the only way with anyone, when you'll be so close as to be living inside each other's skins. ","Some men just aren't cut out for paternity. Better they should realize it before and not after they become responsible for a son. ","It's not about the writing. It's about the feelings behind the words. ","Art has never been made while thinking of art. ","It is better wither to be silent, or to say things of more value than silence. Sooner throw a pearl at hazard than an idle or useless word; and do not say a little in many words, but a great deal in a few. ","Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.

","By the time I'd grown up, I naturally supposed that I'd be grown up. ","Sometimes it seems like God is difficult to find and impossibly far away.

","Everywhere I go I find a poet has been there before me. ","This is the best kind of voyeurism, hearing joy from your neighbors. ","Love is the difficult realization that something other than oneself is real. ","All successful newspapers are ceaselessly querulous and bellicose.

","I've known what it is to be hungry, but I always went right to a restaurant. ","People always call it luck when you've acted more sensibly than they have. ","If your parents never had children, chances are you won't, either.

","You can be a little bit darker and rougher on the stage, partly because when you're in the theater, people have come to see you, and so they kind of know what they're in for.

","The thing that is really hard, and really amazing, is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself. ","You must have a room, or a certain hour or so a day, where you don't know what was in the newspapers that morning... a place where you can simply experience and bring forth what you are and what you might be. ","Take chances, make mistakes. That's how you grow. Pain nourishes your courage. You have to fail in order to practice being brave. ","I have the worst memory ever so no matter who comes up to me - they're just, like, 'I can't believe you don't remember me!\" I'm like, 'Oh Dad I'm sorry!'

","2 is not equal to 3, not even for large values of 2. ","Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.

The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well. Our food should be our medicine. Our medicine should be our food. But to eat when you are sick, is to feed your sickness. ","Wonder is what sets us apart from other life forms.

","A person can learn a lot from a dog, even a loopy one like ours. Marley taught me about living each day with unbridled exuberance and joy, about seizing the moment and following your heart. He taught me to appreciate the simple things - a walk in the woods, a fresh snowfall, a nap in a shaft of winter sunlight.

","Few people can see genius in someone who has offended them. ","There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction. The moment you are old enough to take the wheel, the responsibility lies with you. ","Resolve to edge in a little reading every day, if it is but a single sentence.

","I haven't the slightest idea how to change people, but I still keep a long list of prospective candidates just in case I should ever figure it out. ","Luck is the residue of design. ","Pain (any pain--emotional, physical, mental) has a message. The information it has about our life can be remarkably specific, but it usually falls into one of two categories: \"We would be more alive if we did more of this,\" and, \"Life would be more lovely if we did less of that.\" Once we get the pain's message, and follow its advice, the pain goes away.

","Freedom is just Chaos, with better lighting. ","Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched.

","The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success. Talent is only a starting point in this business. You've got to keep on working that talent.

","All power corrupts, but we need the electricity. ","If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out. ","I was gratified to be able to answer promptly. I said I don't know. ","The best measure of a man's honesty isn't his income tax return. It's the zero adjust on his bathroom scale. ","When you drink the water, remember the spring.

","Politics is the art of preventing people from taking part in affairs which properly concern them. ","Never does the human soul appear so strong and noble as when it foregoes revenge and dares to forgive an injury. ","The marvel of all history is the patience with which men and women submit to burdens unnecessarily laid upon them by their governments. ","To get something done, a committee should consist of no more than three men, two of whom are absent. ","Competence, like truth, beauty and contact lenses, is in the eye of the beholder. ","All important persons have about them someone in a subordinate position who has their ear. These dependents are very susceptible to slights, and, when they are not treated as they think they should be, will by well-directed shafts, constantly repeated, poison the minds of their patrons against those who have provoked their animosity. It is well to keep in with them. ","Blaming another person for a problem often keeps us from examining the different possibilities that may underlie the issue. ","When I walk into my kitchen today, I am not alone. Whether we know it or not, none of us is. We bring fathers and mothers and kitchen tables, and every meal we have ever eaten. Food is never just food. It's also a way of getting at something else: who we are, who we have been, and who we want to be. ","It's important to begin a search on a full stomach. ","The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them: that's the essence of inhumanity. ","Morality, like art, means drawing a line someplace. ","The only time people dislike gossip is when you gossip about them. ","Call home at least once a week. It's a proven fact that we call home less the older we get. And that's wrong. It should be the other way around. As we get older, our parents get older. ","The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams. ","Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana. ","It's the good girls who keep diaries; the bad girls never have the time. ","The greatest of faults, I should say, is to be conscious of none. ","Nothing fails like success. ","Although the world is full of suffering, it is full also of the overcoming of it. ","Ah! Memory impairment: the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle! ","Courage is the price that Life exacts for granting peace. ","Let us make one point, that we meet each other with a smile, when it is difficult to smile. Smile at each other, make time for each other in your family. ","Art is a collaboration between God and the artist, and the less the artist does the better. ","The government consists of a gang of men exactly like you and me. They have, taking one with another, no special talent for the business of government; they have only a talent for getting and holding office. ","When I woke up this morning my girlfriend asked me, 'Did you sleep good?' I said 'No, I made a few mistakes.' ","The wit makes fun of other persons; the satirist makes fun of the world; the humorist makes fun of himself. ","If you would cure anger, do not feed it. Say to yourself: 'I used to be angry every day; then every other day; now only every third or fourth day.' When you reach thirty days offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the gods. ","Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear - not absence of fear. ","The strongest man in the world is the man who stands alone. ","Eating everything you want is not that much fun. When you live a life with no boundaries, there’s less joy. If you can eat anything you want to, what’s the fun in eating anything you want to? ","We are told that people stay in love because of chemistry or because they remain intrigued with each other, because of many kindnesses, because of luck... But part of it has got to be forgiveness and gratefulness. ","For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn? ","If you would be known, and not know, vegetate in a village; If you would know, and not be known, live in a city. ","Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see. ","If you are a dog and your owner suggests that you wear a sweater, suggest that he wear a tail. ","Don't think of retiring from the world until the world will be sorry that you retire. I hate a fellow whom pride or cowardice or laziness drives into a corner, and who does nothing when he is there but sit and growl. Let him come out as I do, and bark. ","When we are angry or depressed in our creativity, we have misplaced our power. We have allowed someone else to determine our worth, and then we are angry at being undervalued. ","I was thinking about the universe wanting to be noticed, and how I had to notice it as best I could. I felt that I owed a debt to the universe that only my attention could repay, and also that I owed a debt to everybody who didn’t get to be a person anymore and everyone who hadn’t gotten to be a person yet. ","If only we'd stop trying to be happy we could have a pretty good time. ","Admit that your own private Mount Everest exists. That is half the battle. ","When someone is giving you their theology, their God words, you should listen hard and be very gentle. The time to deliver your God words is when you are asked. ","I believe love is primarily a choice and only sometimes a feeling. If you want to feel love, choose to love and be patient. ","In Hollywood a marriage is a success if it outlasts milk. ","A university is what a college becomes when the faculty loses interest in students. ","I'm still an atheist, thank God. ","He who praises you for what you lack wishes to take from you what you have. ","If it weren't for baseball, many kids wouldn't know what a millionaire looked like. ","We feel in one world, we think and name in another. Between the two we can set up a system of references, but we cannot fill in the gap. ","Where is human nature so weak as in the bookstore? ","Look at what your idea of success would be. The more that you take in external motivators, the more it reduces your ultimate satisfaction because it doesn't come from inside. ","In battling evil, excess is good; for he who is moderate in announcing the truth is presenting half-truth. He conceals the other half out of fear of the people's wrath. ","Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. ","Even if you do learn to speak correct English, whom are you going to speak it to? ","The problem of power is how to achieve its responsible use rather than its irresponsible and indulgent use - of how to get men of power to live for the public rather than off the public. ","Only sick music makes money today. ","Be a fountain, not a drain. ","You cannot just work out and then eat poorly and expect to lose weight. It doesn’t work that way. ","The easiest way for your children to learn about money is for you not to have any. ","Nothing like a lot of exercise to make you realize you'd rather be lazy and dead sooner. ","When a problem can’t be solved, an attitude of acceptance makes room in your mind and heart for solutions to the problems that do need to be solved. ","Learning to live what you're born with is the process, the involvement, the making of a life. ","The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it. ","Think enthusiastically about everything; but especially about your job. If you do, you'll put a touch of glory in your life. If you love your job with enthusiasm, you'll shake it to pieces. You'll love it into greatness. ","The last time anybody made a list of the top hundred character attributes of New Yorkers, common sense snuck in at number 79.

","The one thing a creator can bring to the table when everybody else has all the money and power is centeredness and the ability to walk away. Never sit at a table you can't walk away from. ","Better be ill spoken of by one before all than by all before one. ","If indeed you must be candid, be candid beautifully. ","You can't have everything. Where would you put it? ","Look in the mirror. The face that pins you with its double gaze reveals a chastening secret. ","Americans are overreachers; overreaching is the most admirable of the many American excesses. ","Sometimes you feel other people's pain worse than your own. We're armored against our own troubles. We can't afford to give in to despair. Then you see someone else struggling, and it breaks your... heart. ","Don't stay in bed, unless you can make money in bed. ","I have never been hurt by anything I didn't say.

","My Father taught me how to be a man – and not by instilling in me a sense of machismo or an agenda of dominance. He taught me that a real man doesn’t take, he gives; he doesn’t use force, he uses logic; doesn’t play the role of trouble-maker, but rather, trouble-shooter; and most importantly, a real man is defined by what’s in his heart, not his pants. ","If the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. ","Washington is the only place where sound travels faster than light. ","A human being is only interesting if he's in contact with himself. I learned you have to trust yourself, be what you are, and do what you ought to do the way you should do it. You have got to discover you, what you do, and trust it. ","One thing is clear to me. You can't know everything you'd like to know. You can't do everything you'd like to do.
